            <p className="text-lg text-[#494647] mb-8">
              Unlike many walk-in clinics, Primary Urgent Care is staffed by board-certified physicians and highly trained nurses – led by an emergency medicine specialist. Having an ER-experienced doctor always on-site means we can handle serious (but non-life-threatening) conditions that other clinics might send to the ER. From broken bones and severe sprains to deep cuts that need stitches, our team provides the expert care you need on the spot. We also offer services like IV fluids, on-site medications, and pediatric care, delivering the same breadth of treatment you'd expect from a hospital emergency department, but in a more accessible setting.
            </p>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-5xl font-bold mb-4">Faster Service & Lower Costs than an ER</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-[#494647] mb-4">
                At Primary Urgent Care, you won't spend hours in a waiting room. In fact, most patients are seen by a provider within 15 minutes of arrival—a huge relief compared to hospital ERs, where wait times can often stretch to several hours. Getting care faster means you start feeling better sooner, instead of sitting in pain or discomfort.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-[#494647]">
                Urgent care is also much easier on your wallet. Our visits typically cost only a fraction of an ER bill—primaryuc.com. For example, a standard visit at Primary Urgent Care is just $69.99, with X-rays around $50, and even MRI imaging for about $200 (self-pay)—all while delivering the same high-quality care. We accept most major insurance plans, but even if you're uninsured, you're welcome here. The bottom line: you get top-tier medical care without the sky-high ER expense.

              <p className="text-lg text-[#494647] mb-4">
                Everything at Primary Urgent Care is designed for your convenience. We welcome walk-ins, offer easy online reservations, and have multiple locations across Palm Beach County making it simple to find "ER-level urgent care near me". Our clinics are open beyond typical doctors' office hours (Monday through Friday, 9am–6pm) so it's easier to get care after work or school when your regular doctor is unavailable. Inside, you'll find a clean, comfortable environment (no crowded, chaotic hospital hallways) and a friendly staff focused on your needs. The result is a stress-free urgent care experience that puts patients first from the moment you walk in.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-[#494647]">
                When an unexpected injury or illness needs attention fast, trust Primary Urgent Care to deliver hospital-level care without the hospital wait or cost – it's the faster, more affordable way to get you feeling better.
