                Under Florida's Personal Injury Protection (PIP) law, you must receive medical care within 14 days of your car accident to unlock PIP benefits no matter who was at fault. Miss this window and the insurance carrier can deny payment for treatment, imaging, prescriptions, and lost wages.<br /><br />
                Even "minor" aches can mask whiplash, internal bleeding, or herniated discs, so book a same-day auto-injury visit or walk in today:
