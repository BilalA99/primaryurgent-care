        description: "Comprehensive care for musculoskeletal injuries with immediate diagnosis and treatment",
        whatItIs: "Sprains, strains, and fractures are common musculoskeletal injuries that can occur from sports activities, falls, accidents, or everyday activities. Sprains involve damage to ligaments (the tough bands of tissue that connect bones), strains affect muscles or tendons, and fractures are breaks in bones. These injuries can range from mild to severe and require prompt medical attention to prevent complications and ensure proper healing. At our urgent care centers, we provide immediate evaluation and treatment for these injuries using advanced imaging technology to accurately diagnose the extent of damage.",
        symptoms: "Common symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising, limited range of motion, and difficulty bearing weight on the affected area. Sprains typically cause pain and instability around joints, while strains result in muscle pain, weakness, and cramping. Fractures may cause severe pain, visible deformity, inability to move the affected area, and sometimes a grinding sensation. Immediate symptoms often include rapid swelling, intense pain that worsens with movement, and visible bruising that develops within hours of the injury.",
        whenToSeekCare: "Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe pain, inability to bear weight, visible deformity, numbness or tingling, or if the injury occurred with a loud popping sound. Our urgent care centers are equipped to handle these injuries immediately, providing faster care than emergency rooms for non-life-threatening musculoskeletal injuries. We can perform X-rays on-site to quickly diagnose fractures and determine the best treatment approach.",
        treatment: "Treatment varies based on the type and severity of injury, but typically includes the RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation), pain management, and immobilization when necessary. Our urgent care providers can apply splints, casts, or braces, provide prescription pain medication if needed, and refer patients to orthopedic specialists for follow-up care. We also offer physical therapy referrals and guidance on rehabilitation exercises to promote proper healing and prevent future injuries.",
        prevention: "Prevention strategies include proper warm-up before physical activity, using appropriate protective equipment, maintaining good physical conditioning, and learning proper techniques for sports and exercise. Regular strength training and flexibility exercises can help prevent strains and sprains by improving muscle and joint stability. Our urgent care centers can provide education on injury prevention and recommend appropriate exercises for specific activities.",
        urgentCareAdvantage: "Our urgent care centers provide immediate access to X-ray imaging and orthopedic evaluation without the long waits typically associated with emergency rooms.
